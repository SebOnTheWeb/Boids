# Boids on CPU and GPU
## Introduction
My implementation of boids for my bachelor thesis at Blekinge Institute of Technology. The thesis was based on measuring and comparing a boid simulation running on singe-core CPU, multi-core CPU and GPU.
The project was built in Visual studio 2017. Rendering was done with DirectX 11 and glm was used for vector fucntionality. \
Measurements used for the thesis can be found under "Boids/measurements".

I have since refactored the project on my free time to improve my skills in refactoring and clean code. 
Test were intentionally not added here due to the scope of the project.

## Controls
Start/pause boid logic by pressing SPACE \
Move the camera with WASD \
Rotate camera with QE \
Change camera direction by moving the mouse while pressing and holding RMB \
Increase camera movement speed by pressing and holding LSHIFT \
Exit with ESC

## Settings
Boid and grid properties can be set in Constants.h \
Computation settings can be set in main.cpp

## Implementation
- This boid algorithm follows the three basic rules; alignment, velocity matching and centering.
- Boids have a maximum and minimum speed.
- Boids start facing in a random direction.
- Boids leaving the grid will be moved to the opposite side.
- Upon start boid logic is paused and can be started with SPACE.
- Camera can be moved while logic is paused.
